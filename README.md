# 📌 Ecommerce Website "Kixa"
Full stack e-commerce website. I started this project after learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics. My goal was to learn real-world development practices. Due throwing myself into a challenging but achievable project with limited web-development knowledge, I had to often rewrite and rethink major parts of the application. I'm not finished yet, but I've already made huge progress compared the first version of the website.

## 🚧 Roadmap
- [ ] Migrate to react
- [ ] Make mobile compatible
- [ ] Login system
- [ ] Admin interface to add products
- [ ] Header category links
